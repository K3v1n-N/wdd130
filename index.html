        <p>Hello, my name is Kevin Noorda. After many frustrating tribulations I now have a functioning website. I am
            grateful for the help I received, now that I am able to push my work through, I am going to take the win!

        <p>Utah is my home state, I was born and raised here. Between serving in the military, serving a mission, and
            traveling for work, I have lived/visited various other places, but like Dorothy said 'There's no place like
            home.' </p>
